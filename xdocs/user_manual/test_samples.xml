<h2>Test Samples describe Test Cases</h2>:
<p>
A test sample element is a controller that controls the creation of test cases.
Although all controllers can technically contain sub-controllers, test sample controllers
will almost never do so.  Their purpose is to describe specific test cases and to
provide the logic necessary to create those test cases.
</p>
<p>
Most test sample controllers will allow users to specify configurations for multiple
test cases by allowing the user to add one or more configuration elements.  The Web
Sample controller, for instance, allows users to add many URL config elements, and
each one will generate one executable test case.  The order of iteration through these
sub-elements is the order they appear in the tree.  Also, the Web Sample controller
allows one to specify a cookie manage and an authorization manager, as well as a default
URL config element.  These extra elements all act like default values, and will be
applied to all test cases generated by the controller.
</p>
<p>
For convenience, one can
configure just the default URL element and forego adding sub-URL elements to the controller.
The controller will treat the default as its single test case (this is only true if
NO URL config elements have been added to the controller).
</p>
<p>
Although one can add cookie managers and authorization managers, it's almost always
preferable to add such elements at the ThreadGroup level.
