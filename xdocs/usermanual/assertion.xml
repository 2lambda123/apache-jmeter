<section name="4.5 Assertions">
<p><b>WORK IN PROGRESS</b></p>

<p>Assertions allow you to assert facts about responses received from the
server being tested. Using an assertion, you can essentially "test" that your
application is returning the results you expect it to. </p>

<p>For instance, you can assert that the response to a query will contain some
particular text. The text you specify can be a Perl-style regular expression, and
you can indicate that the response is to contain the text, or that it should match
the whole response.</p>

<p>You can add an assertion to any Generative Controller. For example, you can
add an assertion to a HTTP Request that checks for the text, "&lt;/HTML&gt;".  JMeter
will then check that the text is present in the HTTP response.  If JMeter cannot find the
text, then it will mark this as a failed request.</p>

<p>To view the assertion results, add an Assertion Listener to the Thread Group.</p>
