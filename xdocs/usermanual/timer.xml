<p>
Timers help program flow by controlling how long JMeter's engine delays between each sample attempt. 
Each sampling thread that runs will pause between every sample, depending on which timers have been chosen. 
</p>
<p>
Timers are added to ThreadGroups. Multiple timers can be added to a ThreadGroup. 
In this case, the sampling thread will sum results from each timer, and delay for that period of time.
