<section name="4.4 Timers" anchor="timers">

<p>By default, a JMeter thread sends requests without pausing between each request.
We recommend that you specify a delay by adding one of the three timers to
your Thread Group. If you do not add a delay, JMeter could overwhelm your server by
making too many requests in a very short amount of time.</p>

<p>The timer will cause JMeter to delay a certain amount of time between each
request that a thread makes.  Remember, threads are independent of one
another, and this applies to the timer delay as well.</p>

<p>
If you choose to add more than one timer to a Thread Group, JMeter takes the sum of
the timers and pauses for that amount of time.</p>
