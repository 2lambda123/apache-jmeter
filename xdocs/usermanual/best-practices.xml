<section name="11.1 Limit the Number of Threads" anchor="limit_threads">
<p>Your hardware's capabilities will limit the number of threads you can effectively
run with JMeter.  It will also depend on how fast your server is (a faster server
gives makes JMeter work harder since it returns request quicker).  The more
JMeter works, the less accurate its timing information will be.  The more work
JMeter does, the more each thread has to wait to get access to the CPU, the more
inflated the timing information gets.  If you need large-scale load testing, consider
<a href="remote-test.html">running JMeter remotely</a> across multiple machines.</p>

<section name="11.4 Using the Proxy Server" anchor="proxy_server">
<p>Refer to <complink name="HTTP Proxy Server"/> for details on setting up the proxy
server.  The most important thing to do is filter out all requests you aren't
interested in.  For instance, there's no point in recording image requests (JMeter can
be instructed to download all images on a page - see <complink name="HTTP Request"/>).
These will just clutter your test plan.  Most likely, there is an extension all your files
share, such as .jsp, .asp, .php, .html or the like. These you should "include" by
entering ".*\.jsp" as an "Include Pattern". </p>
<p>Alternatively, you can exclude images by entering ".*\.gif" as an "Exclude Pattern".
Depending on your application, this may or may not be a better way to go.  You may
also have to exclude stylesheets, javascript files, and other included files.  Test
out your settings to verify you are recording what you want, and then erase and start
fresh.</p>
<p>Although JMeter will record directly to the ThreadGroup if no Logical Controller is
present, it's recommended that you add a <complink name="Simple Controller"/> so that all
samples are recorded there.  This conveniently packages all your samples under one
controller, which can be given a name that describes the test case.</p>
<p>Now, go through the steps of a Test Case.  If you have no pre-defined test cases, use
JMeter to record your actions to define some test cases.  Once you have finished a
definite series of steps, save the entire test case in an appropriately named file.  Then, wipe
clean and start a new test case.  By doing this, you can quickly record a large number of
test case "rough drafts".</p>
<p>The test cases will likely need to be further modified.  For instance, there may
have been some dynamic data in one or more of the samples.  If so, these samples will
 need to be put under a <complink name="Modification Manager"/>.  Currently, there is
 no convenient way to do this other than saving the samples temporarily, deleting them, adding
the Modification Manager, and then reloading the saved samples into the Modification Manager.
This will be fixed in 1.8.</p>
<p>You may also want to put any login pages within a <complink name="Once Only Controller"/>,
so that the login action is done only once per test.  Alternatively, you might put all
the samples but the login page within a <complink name="Loop Controller"/>, to execute
X number of times before repeating the login request.</p>
