<section name="4.3 Listeners">
<p>Listeners provide access to the information JMeter gathers about the test cases while
JMeter runs.  The simplest listener, the <a href="component_reference.html#graph_results">Graph
Results</a> listener plots the response times on a graph.  Listeners usually provide a
graphical view of the data that JMeter generates.</p>

<p>An exception to this is the <a href="component_reference.html#file_reporter">File
Reporter</a>, which, as you might expect, logs the result data to a file.  </p>

<p>Listeners can only be added to a Thread Group, and they only collect information
specific to that Thread Group.  If you have 3 Thread Groups and a listener attached to
each one, those three listeners will show three different sets of data.  </p>

<p>There are several <a href="component_reference.html#listeners">interesting listeners</a>
that come with JMeter.</p>
