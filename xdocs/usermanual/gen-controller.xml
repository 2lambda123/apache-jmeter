<p>Generative Controllers tell JMeter to send requests to a server. JMeter
currently has three such controllers: FTP Request, HTTP Request, and JDBC
request.  Each controller has several properties you can set.  You can further
customize a controller by adding one or more Configuration Elements to it.
Also, note that JMeter sends requests in the order that you add them to the tree.</p>

<p>If you are going to send multiple requests of the same type (for example,
HTTP Request) to the same server, consider using a Defaults Configuration
Element. Each controller has its own Defaults element (see below). </p>

<p>Remember to add a Listener to your Thread Group to view and/or store the
results of your requests to disk.</p>

<p>If your are interested in having JMeter perform basic validation on
the response of your request, add an <a href="assertion.html">Assertion</a> to
the Request controller.  For example, in stress testing a web application, the server
may return a successful "HTTP Response" code, but the page may have errors on it or
may be missing sections. You could add assertions to check for certain HTML tags,
common error strings, and so on. JMeter lets you create these assertions using regular
expressions.</p>
