<section name="4.1 ThreadGroup">
<p>Thread group elements are the beginning points of any test plan.  All elements
of a test plan must be under a thread group.  As the name implies, the thread group
element controls the number of threads JMeter will use to execute your test.  The
controls for a thread group allow you to:
<ul><li>Set the number of threads</li>
<li>Set the ramp-up period</li>
<li>Set the number of times to execute the test</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Each thread will execute the test plan in its entirety and completely independent
of other test threads.  Multiple threads are used to simulate concurrent connections
to your server application.</p>

<p>The ramp-up period tells JMeter how long to take to "ramp-up" to the full number of
threads chosen.  If 10 threads are used, and the ramp-up period is 100 seconds, then
JMeter will take 100 seconds to get all 10 threads up and running.  Each thread will
start 10 (100/10) seconds after the previous thread was begun.  If there are 30 threads
and a ramp-up period of 120 seconds, then each successive thread will be delayed by 4 seconds.</p>

<p>By default, a thread group is configured to loop indefinitely through its elements.
Alternatively, you can set the number of times the thread group will loop before ending.  If the number
is set at one, then JMeter will execute the test only once before stopping.</p>
