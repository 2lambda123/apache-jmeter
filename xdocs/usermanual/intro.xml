<section name="1. Introduction">
<p>
<b>Apache JMeter</b> is a 100% pure Java desktop application designed
	  to load test client/server software
	  (such as a web application).  It may be used
	  to test performance both on static and dynamic
	  resources (files, Servlets, Perl scripts, Java Objects, Data Bases and
	  Queries, FTP Servers and more). It can be used to simulate a heavy
load on a server, network or object to test its strength or to analyze
overall performance under different load types.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, JMeter can help you regression test your application by using
test scripts with assertions to validate that your application is returning the
results you expect.  These assertions use regular expressions to give you maximum
flexibility in designing these test.

<section name="1.1 History">
<p>JMeter was originally written by Stefano Mazzocchi of the Apache Software
Foundation, primarily to test the performance of Apache JServ (a project that has
since been replaced by the Apache Tomcat project).  It has since been redesigned
and re-implemented to improve the UI and JMeter's functional testing capabilities.
</p>
</section>

<section name="1.2 The Future">
<p>JMeter's future will hopefully see it's capabilities rapidly expand as developers
take advantage of JMeter's pluggable architecture.  The primary goal of further
development is to make JMeter the most useful regression testing tool as possible,
without compromising JMeter's load-testing capabilities.
