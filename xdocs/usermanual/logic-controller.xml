<section name="4.2.2 Logic Controllers" anchor="logic_controller">
<p>Logic Controllers let you customize the logic that JMeter uses to 
decide when to send requests.  JMeter currently has five such controllers:
<ul>
  <li><b>Interleave Controller</b> <br></br>Samples only one request instead of 
all requests in a Thread Group for each loop iteration.</li> 

  <li><b>Loop Controller</b> <br></br>Tell JMeter to loop a certain number of times, 
in addition to the loop value you specified for the Thread Group.</li> 

  <li><b>Modification Manager</b> <br></br>Lets you parse the results of previous
requests, and use them to dynamically modify the next request.  </li> 

  <li><b>Once Only Controller</b> <br></br>Tells JMeter to send only one request. This
value overrides the loop value you specified for the Thread Group.</li> 

  <li><b>Simple Controller</b> <br></br>This controller has not functionality except to
help you organize your controllers.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p>You can add Generative Controllers (requests), Configuration Elements, and even
other Logic Controllers to a Logic Controller. </p>  
</section>

<section name="4.2.2.1 Interleave Controller">
<p>If you add requests to this controller, JMeter will alternate among each of the 
requests, sending only one request for each loop interation. For example, if you 
add three HTTP Requests to an Interleave Controller and configure the Thread
Group to loop, here is the sequence in which JMeter sends the requests:
</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<tr valign="top"><td>Loop Iteration</td><td>Description</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>1</td><td>JMeter sends the first HTTP Request.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>2</td><td>JMeter sends the second HTTP Request.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>3</td><td>JMeter sends the third HTTP Request.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>4</td><td>Because there are no more requests in controller, JMeter start over and sends the first HTTP Request.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>5</td><td>JMeter sends the second HTTP Request.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>(and so on)</td><td>...</td></tr>
</table>

<p><a href="../demos/InterleaveTestPlan.jmx">Download</a> an example (see Figure 4.1).  In this example, 
the Thread Group
is configured for two threads with a loop count of five, for a total of ten iterations. JMeter sends the requests
in the following order: News Page, FAQ Page, and Gump Page. Note, the File Reporter
is configured to store the results in a file named "interleave-test.dat" in the current directory.</p>

<p><a href="../demos/InterleaveTestPlan2.jmx">Download</a> another example (see Figure 4.2).  In this 
example, the Thread Group
is configured for a single thread with a loop count of eight.  Notice that the Test Plan has an outer Interleave Controller with
two Interleave Controllers inside of it.</p>

<p>The outer Interleave Controller alternates between the
two inner ones.  Then, of course, each inner Interleave Controller alternates between each of the HTTP Requests.  JMeter
sends the requests in the following order: Home Page, Bug Page, CVS Page, and FAQ Page.
Note, the File Reporter is configured to store the results in a file named "interleave-test2.dat" in the current directory.</p>
