<!--  =================== 2.8 =================== -->

<h1>Version 2.8</h1>

<h2>New and Noteworthy</h2>

<!--  =================== Known bugs =================== -->

<h2>Known bugs</h2>

<p>The Once Only controller behaves correctly under a Thread Group or Loop Controller,
but otherwise its behaviour is not consistent (or clearly specified).</p>

<p>Listeners don't show iteration counts when a If Controller has a condition which is always false from the first iteration (see Bug 52496).  
A workaround is to add a sampler at the same level as (or superior to) the If Controller.
For example a Test Action sampler with 0 wait time (which doesn't generate a sample),
or a Debug Sampler with all fields set to False (to reduce the sample size).
</p>
