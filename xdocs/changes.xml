<!--  =================== 2.5.2 =================== -->

<h1>Version 2.5.2</h1>

<h2>Summary of main changes</h2>

<ul>
</ul>


<!--  =================== Known bugs =================== -->

<h2>Known bugs</h2>

<p>
The Include Controller has some problems in non-GUI mode. 
In particular, it can cause a NullPointerException if there are two include controllers with the same name.
</p>

<p>The Once Only controller behaves correctly under a Thread Group or Loop Controller,
but otherwise its behaviour is not consistent (or clearly specified).</p>

<p>The If Controller may cause an infinite loop if the condition is always false from the first iteration. 
A workaround is to add a sampler at the same level as (or superior to) the If Controller.
For example a Test Action sampler with 0 wait time (which doesn't generate a sample),
or a Debug Sampler with all fields set to False (to reduce the sample size).
</p>

<p>
The menu item Options / Choose Language does not change all the displayed text to the new language.
[The behaviour has improved, but language change is still not fully working]
To override the default local language fully, set the JMeter property "language" before starting JMeter. 
</p>

<!-- =================== Incompatible changes =================== -->

<h2>Incompatible changes</h2>

<p>
JMeter versions since 2.1 failed to create a container sample when loading embedded resources.
This has been corrected; can still revert to the Bug 51939 behaviour by setting the following property:
<code>httpsampler.separate.container=false</code>
</p>
