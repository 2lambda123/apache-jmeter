<!--  =================== 2.8 =================== -->

<h1>Version 2.8</h1>

<h2>New and Noteworthy</h2>

<h3>Core Improvements:</h3>
<h4>Webservice sampler now adds to request the headers that are set through Header Manager</h4>

<h3>GUI and ergonomy Improvements:</h3>
<h4>Allow copy from clipboard to HeaderPanel, headers are supposed to be separated by new line and have the following form name:value</h4>

<h4>Proxy now has a button to add a set of default exclusions for URL patterns, this list can be configured through property : proxy.excludes.suggested</h4>

<!--  =================== Known bugs =================== -->

<h2>Known bugs</h2>

<p>The Once Only controller behaves correctly under a Thread Group or Loop Controller,
but otherwise its behaviour is not consistent (or clearly specified).</p>

<p>Listeners don't show iteration counts when a If Controller has a condition which is always false from the first iteration (see <bugzilla>52496</bugzilla>).  
A workaround is to add a sampler at the same level as (or superior to) the If Controller.
For example a Test Action sampler with 0 wait time (which doesn't generate a sample),
or a Debug Sampler with all fields set to False (to reduce the sample size).
</p>

<p>Webservice sampler does not consider the HTTP response status to compute the status of a response, thus a response 500 containing a non empty body will be considered as successful, see <bugzilla>54006</bugzilla>.
To workaround this issue, ensure you always read the response and add a Response Assertion checking text inside the response.
</p>

<p>
Changing language can break part of the configuration of the following elements (see <bugzilla>53679</bugzilla>):
<ul>
    <li>CSV Data Set Config (sharing mode will be lost)</li>
    <li>Constant Throughput Timer (Calculate throughput based on will be lost)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Note that there is a bug in Java on some Linux systems that manifests
itself as the following error when running the test cases or JMeter itself:
<pre>
 [java] WARNING: Couldn't flush user prefs:
 java.util.prefs.BackingStoreException:
 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Not supported: indent-number
</pre>
This does not affect JMeter operation.
</p>
