1) check for more null to avoid the startup NullPointerExceptions
2) check behavior of those stupid ComboBoxes that don't select their last
edited item
4) force finalization or GC cleanup to avoid the outofmemory exceptions and
performance impact (add a memory meter like in Java2D demo?)
5) make tar.gz distribution without stupid DOS terminations.
